 Black Atlantic: Joan Soriano (Dominican Republic),03/26/2018 08:00 PM,03/26/2018 10:00 PM,"During the last half-century, the intoxicating sounds of bachata have emerged as one of Latin America's most popular musical strains, a spellbinding distillation of disparate African and Latin influences. Shaped around the snap and shuffle of steel-string acoustic guitar and bittersweet songs of romantic yearning, bachata has transcended its initial second-class status in the Dominican Republic, yielding both a dance style and a host of preening young stars. But Joan Soriano, the self-named ""Duke of Bachata,"" is the most dazzling and daring of them all, delving into the traditional origins of the sound.0x0A0x0AThe seventh of fifteen children and the anchor of his family's band, Soriano escaped the countryside outside of Santo Domingo as a teenager, moving to the city to learn from the country's bachata greats. During the next two decades, he shaped a style of his own, infusing the bittersweet lyrics with a keen spiritual longing. His bright guitar playing is as fluent and articulate as his voice is magnetic and interpretive, with a world of feelings wrapped inside every phrase. ""When you hear Soriano's raw interpretation of bachata,"" raved NPR, ""you can't help but wonder how such a beautiful sound was kept quiet for so long.""",Black Atlantic: Music of Africa & The African Diaspora,"","Duke Performances, Africa Initiative, Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), Forum for Scholars and Publics","Africa focus, Caribbean focus, Concert/Music, Student","Tickets: $20 General Admission, $10 Duke Students.

 Black Atlantic: Emeline Michel (Haiti),03/27/2018 08:00 PM,03/27/2018 10:00 PM,"The music of Haiti, much like its people, has always been diverse. A unique synthesis of African, indigenous, French, Spanish, and English influences, Haitian music reflects the turbulent history of the tiny island nation as well as the promise of its fundamental diversity. For twenty years, the singer, songwriter, bandleader, and humanitarian Emeline Michel has delivered a singular distillation of Haiti's musical variety, with songs that draw upon hard funk and soft folk, crackling blues and distinctly Haitian rhythms. The Boston Globe called her ""the elegant, jubilant voice of her island nation, finding the beauty in a country most often characterized by political upheaval and social unrest.""0x0A0x0ABorn in the city of Gonaïves, Michel began singing in her church choir, won a major talent contest as a teenager, and went on to study at the Detroit Jazz Center. Back in Haiti, she became a bona fide star, with her seamless fusion of styles and preternaturally smooth singing reflecting the cultural richness of her country. Hailed as ""a Haitian music diplomat"" by The New York Times, Michel has remained restless, becoming a globetrotting artist in pursuit of progressively nuanced expressions - of longing, belief, and hope for her homeland.",Black Atlantic: Music of Africa & the African Diaspora,"","Duke Performances, Africa Initiative, Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), Forum for Scholars and Publics","Featured, Africa focus, Caribbean focus, Concert/Music, Student","Tickets: $20 General Admission, $10 Duke Students.

 Black Atlantic: Betsayda Machado y la Parranda el Clavo (Venezuela),03/28/2018 08:00 PM,03/28/2018 10:00 PM,"Nearly one-tenth of Venezuela's population is descended from African ancestors brought to the region to work its rich cocoa fields. These Afro-Venezuelans developed a deep if often overlooked cultural heritage, with distinct religious and folk traditions and music that sounds like nothing else in the Americas. At long last, those sounds have started to find their way to stages around the world thanks to the virtuoso singer Betsayda Machado and her backing band La Parranda El Clavo, a drum-and-voice ensemble with airtight, emphatic harmonies and undeniably ecstatic rhythms.0x0A0x0AFor three decades, La Parranda El Clavo performed primarily at village ceremonies and celebrations. Machado, dubbed ""The Black Voice of Barlovento,"" sang with them in the late 1980s. She then moved to Caracas and built a career that ultimately brought the entire group to the United States for the first time in 2017. Their long-delayed stateside debut was unanimously heralded: NPR called it ""one of the most joyful shows in years,"" while The New York Times noted, ""This was the kind of group that world music fans have always been thrilled to discover: vital, accomplished, local, unplugged, deeply rooted.""",Black Atlantic: Music of Africa & the African Diaspora,"","Duke Performances, Africa Initiative, Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), Forum for Scholars and Publics","Africa focus, South America focus, Concert/Music, Student","Tickets: $20 General Admission, $10 Duke Students.

 Black Atlantic: Trio da Kali (Mali),03/29/2018 08:00 PM,03/29/2018 10:00 PM,"Mali's griot heritage is one of the world's true musical marvels. For at least seven centuries, these families of musician-historians have gathered and shared the stories of their communities, amassing an unparalleled oral tradition. Modern descendants of the griot lineage have become international ambassadors for African music, playing major festivals and releasing acclaimed records. Trio da Kali - a beguiling partnership among some of Mali's most revered musical families - is a contender on that growing list. Songlines exclaimed, ""Steeped in tradition, these three brilliant musicians give a new voice to timeless sounds.""0x0A0x0AThe hammered balafon of Lassana Diabaté, a veteran of Toumani Diabaté's bands, anchors the Trio with lyrical, agile melodies. Mamadou Kouyaté adds bass with the ngoni, a modern version of the ancient guitar-lute. Griotte Hawa Kassé Mady, daughter of legendary singer Kassé Mady Diabaté, sings with authority and charm, leading the group with a voice warm and resonant enough to warrant frequent comparisons to American gospel great Mahalia Jackson.",Black Atlantic: Music of Africa and the African Diaspora,"","Duke Performances, Africa Initiative, Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), Forum for Scholars and Publics","Africa focus, Concert/Music, Student","Tickets: $20, $10 Duke Students.

 Black Atlantic: Aurelio (Garifuna/Honduras),03/30/2018 08:00 PM,03/30/2018 10:00 PM,"The Garifuna people, language, and culture transcend geographical borders. The Garifuna (or Garinagu) originated with a seventeenth-century shipwreck of plantation-bound Nigerians off the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. The survivors took shelter in Arawak communities, thus escaping slavery, but a series of forced migrations took them to the mainland, where they settled on a thin strip of coastline that stretches southward from Belize to Nicaragua. Garifuna music, epitomized by a shuffling rhythm dubbed the paranda and mingling the sounds of West Africa and the Caribbean, is upbeat and irrepressible, a lingering testament to survival. No one has represented that musical tradition with the same energy or appeal as singer, guitarist, and politician Aurelio Martínez.0x0A0x0ABorn into a musical family in the small Honduran coastal outpost of Plaplaya, Aurelio became his town's percussion prodigy before going away to school, where he began to develop the vocabulary that would help him revitalize Garifuna traditions. His deep, commanding voice and the rich, full sound of his band led to international attention and a collaboration with Afropop legend Youssou N'Dour that cemented his star status. Called ""one of the greatest artists of Latin America"" by the London Evening Standard and ""a musical guardian of the Garifuna"" by NPR, Aurelio has become a powerhouse performer of the highest order.",Black Atlantic: Music of Africa and the African Diaspora,"","Duke Performances, Africa Initiative, Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), Forum for Scholars and Publics","Africa focus, Central America focus, Caribbean focus, Concert/Music, Student","Tickets: $20, $10 Duke Students.

 Black Atlantic: Diego El Cigala (Spain/Dominican Republic),03/31/2018 08:00 PM,03/31/2018 10:00 PM,"Diego El Cigala emerged as a modern flamenco icon in the late 1990s. With his distinctive gravelly voice and his luxuriant black curls, he conjured the romance of the form, updating it with a swagger all his own. But El Cigala was never content to sing mere flamenco. Indeed, his 2004 collaboration with legendary Cuban pianist Bebo Valdés daringly tied his style to dashing Cuban rhythms, suggesting that his future extended far beyond Andalusian territory. A decade later, he explored tango, even winning a Latin GRAMMY in the genre. It became clear that El Cigala was interested in exploring raw, emotional music, no matter the country of origin.0x0A0x0AThat is the underlying concept of Indestructible, El Cigala's masterful 2016 album of spirited salsa, delivered with authoritative flamenco power. El Cigala, who became a citizen of the Dominican Republic in 2014, traveled between Spain, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Colombia, New York, and Miami to record these songs. Recruiting musicians from each of those musical epicenters, El Cigala explored the salsa canon while working to stretch it with stylistic brio. He returns to Durham, this time with a ten-piece band, investing this material with even more energy. El Cigala and his band pull together the sounds and sources of the world's foremost centers of tropical music.","","","Duke Performances, Africa Initiative, Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), Forum for Scholars and Publics","Africa focus, Caribbean focus, Europe focus, Concert/Music, Student","Tickets: $45, $40, $30, $10 Duke Students",Carolina Theater,"Hunt, Gloria",http://dukeperformances.duke.edu/events/diego-el-cigala-spaindominican-republic/,http://calendar.duke.edu/events/show.html?fq=id:CAL-2c918082-61028bd8-0161-0515671d-00001184demobedework@mysite.edu

Planet Unplugged on Environmental Rights Defenders,04/02/2018 12:00 PM,04/02/2018 01:00 PM,"Phyllis is a Kenyan grassroots social justice activist. She has been vocal in advocating for the right to a clean and healthy environment for the Owino Uhuru community near Mombasa, and in 2015 she was the Africa recipient of the prestigious Goldman Prize, the world's foremost environmental award. After learning her own breast milk was making her baby sick and realizing her child wasn't the only one suffering from lead poisoning, Phyllis galvanized the community to shut down a local smelter that was exposing people to dangerous chemicals. She has since launched an NGO dedicated to empowering communities affected by extractive industries. Her campaign last year helped to spark a national outcry in Kenya that resulted in a parliamentary task force to address the issues of pollution. This lead to the shutdown of smelters located dangerously close to human settlements across the country.","",Phyllis Omido,"Africa Initiative, Nicholas School of the Environment","Sustainability, Entrepreneurship, Africa focus, Multicultural/Identity, Ethics, Human Rights, Civic Engagement/Social Action, Diversity/Inclusion, Global, Humanities, Natural Sciences, Politics, Social Sciences, Health/Wellness, Lecture/Talk, Conference/Symposium, Meeting, Workshop/Short Course, Research, Reception, Social, Volunteer/Community Service, Information Session, Free Food and Beverages","",LSRC B101 Love Auditorium,"Watkins, Meredith","",http://calendar.duke.edu/events/show.html?fq=id:CAL-2c918085-6222e399-0162-2a81acde-00002b78demobedework@mysite.edu
